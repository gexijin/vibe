## Writing Guidelines

### Structure (500-800 words)

1. **Catchy Title**
   - Intriguing and specific
   - Hints at the impact
   - Avoids jargon when possible

2. **Engaging Hook (1-2 paragraphs)**

3. **The Story (3-4 paragraphs)**
   - Explain the research clearly
   - What was done and how?
   - What did they find?
   - Use storytelling techniques:
     - Describe the challenge
     - Show the breakthrough
     - Explain the solution

4. **Why It Matters (2-3 paragraphs)**
   - Clinical implications
   - Future research directions
   - Potential applications
   - What doors does this open?

5. **The Details**
   - Links to original papers
   - Links to blog discussions
   - Credit to researchers and bloggers

6. **Conclusion (1 paragraph)**
   - Tie it together
   - Look forward
   - Leave readers excited

### Tone and Style

**Do:**
- Write in active voice
- Use vivid, concrete language
- Break down complex concepts step-by-step
- Use analogies when helpful
- Show enthusiasm for the science
- Make it conversational but professional
- Use short paragraphs for readability

**Don't:**
- Oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy
- Use excessive jargon without explanation
- Write in passive academic style
- Bury the lead
- Make unsupported claims

### Storytelling Techniques

1. **The Challenge-Solution Arc**
   - What problem existed?
   - Why was it hard?
   - How did this research solve it?

2. **The Impact Lens**
   - Start with why readers should care
   - Connect to real-world outcomes
   - Show the bigger picture

3. **The Human Element**
   - Mention researchers when relevant
   - Acknowledge the community discussion
   - Show the collaborative nature of science

4. **The Future Vision**
   - What's next?
   - What becomes possible?
   - What questions remain?
