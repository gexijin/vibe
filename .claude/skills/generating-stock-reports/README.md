# Generating Stock Reports Skill

A Claude Code Skill that automatically generates comprehensive company and stock reports using web search.

## Overview

This Skill converts the `/stock-report` slash command into an autonomous capability. When users ask about companies or stocks, Claude automatically activates this Skill to research and generate detailed reports without requiring explicit command invocation.

## Key Difference: Skill vs Slash Command

| Feature | Slash Command | Skill |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Invocation** | User types `/stock-report AAPL` | Claude decides when to use it |
| **Trigger** | Explicit command | Natural language (e.g., "Tell me about Apple") |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed format | Adapts to context |
| **Discovery** | User must know command exists | Automatic based on conversation |

## Installation

This is a **project skill** located in `.claude/skills/generating-stock-reports/`. It's automatically available to all team members who clone this repository.

### For Personal Use

To make this Skill available across all your projects:

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/generating-stock-reports ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Usage Examples

The Skill activates automatically when you mention companies or stocks:

```
User: What's happening with Apple lately?
Claude: [Activates generating-stock-reports Skill]
        [Researches Apple Inc.]
        [Generates comprehensive report]
        [Saves as Apple_2025-12-13.md]
```

```
User: I'm interested in TSLA
Claude: [Activates Skill and generates Tesla report]
```

```
User: Compare Microsoft and Google's cloud businesses
Claude: [Activates Skill for both companies]
        [Generates comparative analysis]
```

## What This Skill Does

1. **Automatic Recognition**: Detects when users ask about companies or stocks
2. **Web Research**: Searches for recent news across four key areas:
   - Product & service developments
   - Management & leadership news
   - Financial performance
   - Analyst insights
3. **Report Generation**: Creates well-structured markdown reports
4. **File Output**: Automatically saves reports with date-stamped filenames

## Files in This Skill

```
generating-stock-reports/
├── SKILL.md          # Main skill instructions (what Claude reads)
├── EXAMPLES.md       # Sample reports showing expected output
└── README.md         # This file (documentation for humans)
```

## Configuration

### Tool Access

This Skill uses:
- **WebSearch** - Primary research tool
- **Write** - Save reports to files

No tool restrictions are set, allowing Claude to use additional tools if needed for context.

### Customization

To modify the Skill behavior:

1. Edit `SKILL.md` to change instructions
2. Update the `description` in YAML frontmatter to change when it activates
3. Modify sections in the template structure
4. Add constraints in the quality guidelines

After editing, Claude will use the updated Skill immediately (no restart required).

## Quality Standards

Reports generated by this Skill include:

✓ Information from the last 3-6 months
✓ Data from credible financial news sources
✓ Specific metrics, dates, and numbers
✓ Balanced perspective (pros and cons)
✓ Proper citations with source URLs
✓ Professional markdown formatting
✓ Automatic file saving

## Comparison with Slash Command

### When to Use Each

**Use the Slash Command** (`/stock-report AAPL`):
- You want to explicitly trigger a stock report
- You're teaching others about the command
- You want the exact same behavior every time
- You're scripting or automating reports

**Let the Skill Activate**:
- You're having a natural conversation about companies
- You want Claude to decide if a full report is needed
- You want adaptive behavior based on your questions
- You prefer not to remember specific commands

### Migration Path

You can keep both! The slash command and Skill can coexist:

- **Slash command**: Direct, explicit control
- **Skill**: Automatic, conversational activation

## Testing

To test if the Skill is working:

1. **Direct mention**: "Tell me about Microsoft"
   - Should activate Skill and generate report

2. **Ticker symbol**: "What's happening with TSLA?"
   - Should recognize Tesla and generate report

3. **Investment question**: "Should I research Apple or Google?"
   - Should offer to generate reports for both

4. **Check file output**: Verify markdown files are created with proper naming

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

**Problem**: Claude doesn't use the Skill when you mention companies

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you're asking about specific companies (not general market questions)
- Check that SKILL.md exists in `.claude/skills/generating-stock-reports/`
- Verify YAML frontmatter has proper syntax
- Try more explicit phrasing: "Generate a report on Apple"

### Incomplete Reports

**Problem**: Reports missing sections or information

**Solutions**:
- Check web search is working (test with a direct search)
- Verify sources are accessible (some financial sites may block automated access)
- Ask Claude to "continue" or "add more detail to [section]"

### Wrong Format

**Problem**: Report not saved as markdown or wrong filename

**Solutions**:
- Check the instructions in SKILL.md specify markdown format
- Verify file naming pattern: `{CompanyName}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Ensure Write tool is available

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Focus Areas

Request specialized reports:

```
Tell me about NVDA's AI chip business specifically
```

The Skill adapts while maintaining core structure.

### Comparative Analysis

```
Compare AMD and NVDA in the GPU market
```

Generates analysis across both companies.

### Historical Context

```
What's changed with Apple over the last year?
```

Emphasizes timeline and evolution.

## Contributing

To improve this Skill:

1. Edit SKILL.md with clearer instructions
2. Add more examples to EXAMPLES.md
