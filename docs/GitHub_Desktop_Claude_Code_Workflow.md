# Using GitHub Desktop with Claude Code

## The Problem

You're coding with AI assistance. Claude makes changes to your files. Sometimes the changes work perfectly. Sometimes they don't. You want to experiment boldly, but you need a safety net.

**Version control is like an unlimited undo button for your entire project.** Every time you save a snapshot (called a "commit"), you create a restore point. You can always go back.

When you combine [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), you get AI-speed development with professional version control.

## Key Concepts

**Git** tracks every change to your files on your computer.

**GitHub** stores your code in the cloud as backup.

**GitHub Desktop** makes Git visual - you click buttons instead of typing commands.

**Claude Code** is an AI coding assistant that writes code, fixes bugs, and creates commits for you.

## What You'll Do

Build a simple timer app with Claude Code and track all changes with GitHub Desktop:
- Create project and timer app
- Test and fix errors
- Commit and push changes
- Discard bad changes and try again
- Let Claude automate commits

## What You'll Need

- GitHub Desktop installed ([download](https://desktop.github.com))
- Claude Code installed ([guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation))
- GitHub account (free at [github.com](https://github.com))
- Web browser
- Basic terminal familiarity

## Step 1: Create Your Project

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **File** → **New Repository**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `simple-timer`
   - **Description:** `A timer app built with Claude Code`
   - **Local Path:** Documents folder
   - **Check** "Initialize this repository with a README"
4. Click **Create Repository**
5. Click **Publish repository** at the top
6. Click **Publish Repository**

You now have a local project and cloud backup on GitHub.

## Step 2: Ask Claude to Create the Timer App

1. Open your **terminal**
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```
   cd ~/Documents/simple-timer
   ```
3. Start Claude Code:
   ```
   claude
   ```
4. Type this request:
   ```
   Create a simple countdown timer app in a single HTML file called timer.html.
   It should have:
   - An input field to set minutes
   - Start and Stop buttons
   - Display showing time remaining in MM:SS format
   - When timer reaches zero, display "Time's up!"
   Keep it simple with inline CSS and JavaScript.
   ```
5. Press **Enter**

Claude creates the `timer.html` file (takes 10-30 seconds).

## Step 3: Test the Timer

1. In GitHub Desktop, click **Repository** → **Show in Finder/Explorer**
2. **Double-click** `timer.html` to open it in your browser
3. Try the timer:
   - Type `1` in the input field
   - Click **Start**
   - Watch the countdown

**If it works:** Move to Step 5.
**If something's broken:** Continue to Step 4.

## Step 4: Fix Errors (If Needed)

1. Open browser console (`F12` → **Console** tab)
2. Copy any red error messages
3. Go back to Claude Code in your terminal
4. Paste the error:
   ```
   I'm seeing this error: [paste error]. Can you fix it?
   ```
5. Press **Enter**
6. Refresh browser (`F5`) and test again

## Step 5: Review Changes

1. Switch to **GitHub Desktop**
2. **Left panel:** Shows changed files (`timer.html`)
3. **Right panel:** Shows the code (green = added)
4. Read through to understand what Claude created

Always review AI-generated code before committing.

## Step 6: Commit Manually

1. At bottom left, in **Summary field**, type:
   ```
   Create initial timer app with start/stop functionality
   ```
2. Click **Commit to main**

You've created a save point!

**Good messages:** "Create initial timer app", "Fix start button"
**Bad messages:** "changes", "update", "asdf"

## Step 7: Push to GitHub

1. Click **Push origin** button at top
2. Verify: **Repository** → **View on GitHub** to see your code online

Your code is now backed up in the cloud.

## Step 8: Add Sound Notification

1. In Claude Code terminal:
   ```
   Add a sound notification when the timer reaches zero. Use the browser's
   built-in beep sound or create a simple audio alert.
   ```
2. Press **Enter**
3. Test: Refresh browser, set timer for 0.1 minutes, click Start

**For this tutorial:** Pretend the sound doesn't work well. Don't commit yet!

## Step 9: Discard Bad Changes

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **Branch** menu → **Discard All Changes**
3. Click **Discard Changes** to confirm
4. Refresh browser - timer works without the sound!

You just threw away broken code and went back to your last save point.

## Step 10: Redo from Scratch

1. In Claude Code:
   ```
   Add a sound notification when the timer reaches zero. This time, use an HTML5
   audio element with a simple beep sound generated by the Web Audio API. Make
   sure it handles browser autoplay restrictions gracefully.
   ```
2. Test immediately (refresh browser, set 0.1 minutes, Start)

**If it works:** Continue to Step 11.
**If not:** Paste error to Claude or try again.

## Step 11: Let Claude Commit and Push

1. In Claude Code:
   ```
   commit and push my changes
   ```
2. Press **Enter**

Claude will check changes, write a commit message, commit, and push (10-20 seconds).

**When to use:**
- Manual commits: When learning or want control
- Claude commits: When working fast and want good messages

## Step 12: Ask Claude to Summarize Changes

1. In Claude Code:
   ```
   what files have I changed?
   ```

Claude explains your changes in plain English.

**Try:** `explain what the audio code does` or `show me the last 5 commits`

## Step 13: View History

1. In **GitHub Desktop**, click **History** tab

You'll see:
- Initial commit (README)
- Create initial timer app
- Add improved sound notification

Notice the first failed sound attempt isn't there - you discarded it! Only working code made it into your commits.

## How to Reopen

**GitHub Desktop:** Start menu/Spotlight → type "GitHub Desktop"

**Claude Code:**
```
cd ~/Documents/simple-timer
claude
```

**Project files:** In GitHub Desktop → **Repository** → **Show in Finder/Explorer**

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed":** GitHub Desktop → File/Preferences → Accounts → Sign out and sign in again

**Claude says "not a git repository":** Make sure you're in the right folder (`cd ~/Documents/simple-timer`)

**Timer doesn't work:** Open browser console (`F12`), copy errors, paste to Claude

## The Complete Workflow

1. Ask Claude to make changes
2. Test in browser
3. If it works → Review and commit
4. If it fails → Discard and try again
5. Push to GitHub
6. Repeat

Manual commits when you want control. Claude commits when you want speed. Discard fearlessly - only commit working code!

## Next Steps

Try adding features to your timer:

**Quick wins:**
- Preset buttons for 5, 10, 15 minutes: `Add three preset buttons: "5 min", "10 min", and "15 min"`
- Pause button: `Add a Pause/Resume button that toggles the timer state`
- Better styling: `Improve the visual design with a modern color scheme`

**More challenging:**
- Custom sound: Download a free .mp3 from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org), put in your project folder, ask Claude to use it
- Multiple timers: `Allow users to create and run multiple timers simultaneously`
- Progress bar: `Add a progress bar that visually shows how much time remains`

**Remember:** Test after each feature, commit after each success, discard failures.

**View your project on GitHub.com:** Click **Repository** → **View on GitHub** in GitHub Desktop to see your complete commit history and code online.
