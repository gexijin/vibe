# Use GitHub Desktop with Claude Code

You're coding with AI assistance. It makes changes to your files. Sometimes the changes work perfectly. Sometimes they don't. **Version control is like an undo button for your entire project.** Every time you save a snapshot (called a "commit"), you create a restore point. You can always go back.

When you combine [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), you get AI-speed development with professional version control.

## Key Concepts

**Git** tracks every change to your files on your computer.

**GitHub** stores your code in the cloud as backup.

**GitHub Desktop** makes Git visual - you click buttons instead of typing commands.

**Claude Code** is an AI coding assistant that writes code, fixes bugs, and creates commits for you.

## What You'll Do

Build a simple timer app with Claude Code and track all changes with GitHub Desktop:
- Create project and timer app
- Test and fix errors
- Commit and push changes
- Discard bad changes and try again
- Let Claude automate commits

## What You'll Need

- Finished [Installing Claude Code on Windows](./Install_CLAUDE_Code_Win) or [Installing Claude Code on Mac](./Install_Claude_Code_MacOS)
- Finished [Getting Started with Version Control](./Github_desktop)
- 20 minutes

## Step 1: Create Your Project

- Open **GitHub Desktop**
- Click **File** → **New Repository**
- Fill in:
  - **Name:** `test_claude`
  - **Description:** `A timer app built with Claude Code`
  - **Local Path:** Documents folder
  - **Check** "Initialize this repository with a README"
- Click **Create Repository**
- Click **Publish repository** at the top
- Click **Publish Repository**

You now have a local project and cloud backup on GitHub.

## Step 2: Ask Claude to Create the Timer App

- Open your **terminal**
- Navigate to your project:
  ```
  cd ~/Documents/test_claude
  ```
- Start Claude Code:
  ```
  claude
  ```

Log in with your Claude subscription following the installation tutorial ([Windows](Install_CLAUDE_Code_Win.md) | [Mac](Install_Claude_Code_MacOS.md)). After logging in, you'll see a welcome message and the Claude Code prompt.

- Type this request:
  ```
  Create a simple countdown timer app in a single file called timer.html.
  It should have:
  - An input field to set minutes
  - Start and Stop buttons
  - Display showing time remaining in MM:SS format
  - When timer reaches zero, display 'Time's up!'
  Keep it simple with inline CSS and JavaScript.
  ```

Claude creates the `timer.html` file (takes 10-30 seconds).

## Step 3: Test the Timer

- In GitHub Desktop, click **Repository** → **Show in Finder/Explorer**
- **Double-click** `timer.html` to open it in your browser
- Try the timer:
  - Type `1` in the input field
  - Click **Start**
  - Watch the countdown

**If it works:** Move to Step 5.
**If something's broken:** Continue to Step 4.

## Step 4: Fix Errors (If Needed)

- Open browser console (right-click on page → **Inspect** → **Console** tab)
- Copy any red error messages
- Go back to Claude Code in your terminal
- Paste the error:
  ```
  I'm seeing this error: [paste error]. Can you fix it?
  ```
- Refresh browser (click the reload button or right-click → **Reload**) and test again

## Step 5: Review Changes

- Switch to **GitHub Desktop**
- **Left panel:** Shows changed files (`timer.html`)
- **Right panel:** Shows the code (green = added)
- Read through to understand what Claude created

Always review AI-generated code before committing.

## Step 6: Commit Manually

- At bottom left, in **Summary field**, type:
  ```
  Create initial timer app with start/stop functionality
  ```
- Click **Commit to main**

You've created a save point!

**Good messages:** "Create initial timer app", "Fix start button"
**Bad messages:** "changes", "update", "asdf"

## Step 7: Push to GitHub

- Click **Push origin** button at top
- Verify: **Repository** → **View on GitHub** to see your code online

Your code is now backed up in the cloud.

## Step 8: Add Sound Notification

- In Claude Code terminal:
  ```
  Add a sound notification when the timer reaches zero. Use the browser's
  built-in beep sound or create a simple audio alert.
  ```
- Test: Refresh browser, set timer for 0.1 minutes, click Start

**For this tutorial:** Pretend the sound doesn't work well. Don't commit yet!

## Step 9: Discard Bad Changes

  Sometimes AI put us on the wrong path and we need to start over from our last commit (save point).

- Open **GitHub Desktop**
- Click **Branch** menu → **Discard All Changes**
- Click **Discard Changes** to confirm
- Refresh browser - timer works without the sound!

You just threw away broken code and went back to your last save point.

## Step 10: Redo from Scratch

- In Claude Code:
  ```
  Add a sound notification when the timer reaches zero. This time, use an HTML5
  audio element with a simple beep sound generated by the Web Audio API. Make
  sure it handles browser autoplay restrictions gracefully.
  ```
- Test immediately (refresh browser, set 0.1 minutes, Start)

**If it works:** Continue to Step 11.
**If not:** Paste error to Claude or try again.

## Step 11: Let Claude Commit and Push

- In Claude Code:
  ```
  commit and push my changes
  ```

Claude will check changes, write a commit message, commit, and push (10-20 seconds).

**When to use:**
- Manual commits: When learning or want control
- Claude commits: When working fast and want good messages

## Step 12: Ask Claude to Summarize Changes

- In Claude Code:
  ```
  what files have I changed?
  ```

Claude explains your changes in plain English.

**Try:** `explain what the audio code does` or `show me the last 5 commits`

## Step 13: View History

- In **GitHub Desktop**, click **History** tab

You'll see:
- Initial commit (README)
- Create initial timer app
- Add improved sound notification

Notice the first failed sound attempt isn't there - you discarded it! Only working code made it into your commits.

## Challenges
- Custom sound: Download a free .mp3 from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org), put in your project folder, ask Claude to use it
- Multiple timers: `Allow users to create and run multiple timers simultaneously`
- Progress bar: `Add a progress bar that visually shows how much time remains`

**Remember:** Test after each feature, commit after each success, discard failures.

**View your project on GitHub.com:** Click **Repository** → **View on GitHub** in GitHub Desktop to see your complete commit history and code online.

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed":** GitHub Desktop → File/Preferences → Accounts → Sign out and sign in again

**Claude says "not a git repository":** Make sure you're in the right folder (`cd ~/Documents/test_claude`)

**Timer doesn't work:** Open browser console (right-click → **Inspect** → **Console**), copy errors, paste to Claude

## The Complete Workflow

- Ask Claude to make changes
- Test in browser
- If it works → Review and commit
- If it fails → Discard and try again
- Push to GitHub
- Repeat

Manual commits when you want control. Claude commits when you want speed. Discard fearlessly - only commit working code!

## Next Steps

Try adding features to your timer:

**Quick wins:**
- Preset buttons for 5, 10, 15 minutes: `Add three preset buttons: "5 min", "10 min", and "15 min"`
- Pause button: `Add a Pause/Resume button that toggles the timer state`
- Better styling: `Improve the visual design with a modern color scheme`
